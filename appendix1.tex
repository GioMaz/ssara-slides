\begin{definition}[Chromatic Number]
    Given graph $G = (V, E)$, the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colors required, so that no two adjacent nodes are assigned the same color.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Size of the Maximum Clique]
    Given graph $G = (V, E)$, and $C \subseteq V$ a maximum clique of $G$, the size of the maximum clique $\omega(G)$ is the cardinality of $C$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Chromatic Number]
    Given graph $G = (V, E)$, if $G$ has a PEO, then $\chi(G) = \omega(G)$.
\end{theorem}
